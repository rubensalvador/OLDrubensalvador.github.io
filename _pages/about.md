I am an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), with a reasearch appointment at the [IETR (Institut d’Électronique et des Technologies du numéRique)](https://www.ietr.fr/en) in Rennes, France.

My research interests span the areas of **embedded computing architectures, reconfigurable computing, hardware security and self-adaptive systems**. I work on building reconfigurable architectures for adaptive hardware, designing and programming novel accelerator architectures and digging around with hardware security. Recently, I started working on hardware security for machine learning, specifically on side-channel attacks resistant implementations of DL hardware accelerators. Overall, my research work aims at building more efficient, secure and intelligent systems.

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor (2017–2019) and Teaching Assistant (2012–2017) at [UPM](https://www.upm.es/) (Technical University of Madrid).

I obtained my PhD (2015) in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [CEI](http://www.cei.upm.es/) (Center of Industrial Electronics, UPM) working on evolvable hardware in FPGAs, under the supervision of Professors [Eduardo de la Torre](http://www.cei.upm.es/people/faculty/eduardo-de-la-torre/) (CEI, UPM) and [Lukáš Sekanina](https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/sekanina/) (Brno University of Technology).

Even before that I was a Research Assistant (2006–2011) at CEI, UPM, and a Research Engineer (2005–2006) at [INSIA](https://insia-upm.es/en/) (Intelligent Vehicle Systems unit, University Institute for Automobile research, UPM).
